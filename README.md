Ruth Percino-Daniel et al 

In this manuscript we quantify the extent to which divergence is driven by abiotic factors such as temperature, precipitation and elevation when compared to geographic distance. We used restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) from individuals collected from 100 m to 2250 m of elevation at Sierra Madre de Chiapas in southern Mexico. Using a combination of phylogenetics and population genetics approaches, we found that a null model of isolation-by-distance was not supported, and divergence is more likely influenced by the interaction between elevation and precipitation, but also temperature. Our results underscore the importance of isolation by environment and highlight that spatial analyses can illuminate fine scale population structure.
